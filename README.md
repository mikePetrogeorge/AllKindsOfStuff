A sample IOS storyboard app for demo purposes

This is a simple app used to demo concepts. It starts off with a UIView, then it moves through the storyboard Segue, present a UIDatePicker, a UISegmentedControl, a UISwitch, a UITextField and three UIButtons. There is a UILabel that is changed each time one of these controls was changed.

Mainly wrote this to demonstrate KIT and MonkeyTalk frameworks. The code is really not rocket science, but its a quick and app to test against a demo your trying to do.
